1
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:26,014
ORTEGA - BANDIT WANTED
FOR CRIMES POLITICAL & CIVIL

2
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:27,742
AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF MEXICO

3
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,259
2,000 - ORTEGA

4
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:27,255
Bastards! Scum! Come back!

5
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:29,182
Come back, you thief!

6
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:34,376
Do something, you sons of goats!

7
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,773
He has taken my best girl!

8
00:05:46,064 --> 00:05:48,020
You will hang, Ortega!

9
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:25,456
For God and the Republic you will hang!

10
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:18,814
BLUE

11
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:45,934
This food is not cooked, Soledad.

12
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:47,059
Mine has too much salt.

13
00:09:47,144 --> 00:09:49,863
Silence. Speak to your mother
with respect.

14
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:52,742
Soledad is Xavier's mother.
She is my mother.

15
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:01,177
Who remembers?

16
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,852
I have many sons. And many sons
should have many mothers. Is logic.

17
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:11,616
Also more enjoyable.

18
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:17,976
Now go to the whore Inez
who you will not remember.

19
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:20,180
I have sons here who are sons.

20
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:30,023
We must honour this harlot.
She's famous in the world.

21
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:34,177
One time in the capital,
she serviced a whole military prison.

22
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:36,657
On a Sunday.

23
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:47,297
Azul, the woman wishes you first.

24
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:51,222
Come to her, Azul.
I've lit her fires for you.

25
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:56,863
I do not understand.

26
00:10:56,944 --> 00:11:00,334
This Azul will kiss the lips
of the Captain of the Police...

27
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,335
but he will not kiss Inez.

28
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:05,622
Has he not heard of my fame
in the capital?

29
00:12:57,184 --> 00:13:00,415
We do not use our knives
to kill our brothers.

30
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:10,622
Now shake the hand.

31
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:17,254
You will make peace with my son.

32
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:19,942
A gringo is your son?

33
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:24,820
This one is no gringo. No more.

34
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:28,773
He has become my son.
As you are, Xavier.

35
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:32,981
You will shake the hand.

36
00:13:36,704 --> 00:13:38,456
I have ordered it!

37
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:50,503
There's a sweet smell in the night,
Carlos, but you wear a sour face.

38
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:51,653
Go away.

39
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:53,496
You are a fool, Angel.

40
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:57,497
It is good for young boys to fight.
It turns them into men.

41
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,936
You've learned little of this life,
my brother.

42
00:15:04,224 --> 00:15:06,294
I have learned to be a leader of men.

43
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:07,612
You're a leader of bandits...

44
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:10,218
teaching the one who is not your son
to be the same.

45
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:12,499
I am a leader of revolutionaries...

46
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:14,620
and if I choose Azul above the others...

47
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:17,298
it is because Azul is worth more
than my blood.

48
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,579
He's more like me than my blood...

49
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,212
and one day, will be a leader as I am.

50
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,295
For the cause, Carlos.

51
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:28,616
- We do not fight for the cause anymore.
- Take care, old man. You provoke.

52
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:33,539
I will provoke if I wish.
I'm older than you.

53
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:41,013
Do you think your men are not tired
of the way that we live?

54
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:44,375
They do not wear sour faces,
but behind their faces they doubt now.

55
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:46,580
They question and they wonder.

56
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:50,420
You say we must destroy the French
and the Spanish...

57
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:54,053
and the rich Yanquis who devour Mexico
and swallow her bones.

58
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:56,578
And yet we do not attack the French
and the Spanish.

59
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,337
And the rich Yanquis, if they are rich...

60
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:01,859
stay on their side of the river.

61
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:04,895
No, my lovely brother.

62
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:08,779
We only play games,
children's games...

63
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:11,214
or the games of madmen.

64
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:15,820
What is the day today?

65
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:20,257
A Thursday. The third day of July.

66
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:22,857
So I believed.

67
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:27,263
We will do something new tomorrow.

68
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:30,777
In the north.

69
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:09,656
The land across the river
belonged to the people of Mexico...

70
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:12,417
before the gringos took it for their own.

71
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:17,694
Now, on the day these Yanquis call
their Day of Independence...

72
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,775
we go back for land.

73
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:26,542
And what our regular armies
could not keep for us, we take.

74
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:30,293
Azul...

75
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:33,979
and Xavier will lead.

76
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:09,854
I know what you think,
that this is the land of your people.

77
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:12,219
But they are not your people now.

78
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:14,656
You are one of us.

79
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:50,783
They celebrate the Day of Independence
as I had thought.

80
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:24,976
- Look at your boy.
- Look at him.

81
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:29,935
- Mighty fine boy.
- Mighty pretty gal.

82
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:40,218
Save your energy for the wedding, Jess.

83
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:50,500
I reckon you and Doc will have to start
putting up a wedding soon, Abe.

84
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:53,542
If our crops are good, God willing,
maybe so.

85
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:57,863
But that's for the young folks to decide,
wouldn't you say, Doctor?

86
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:22,258
You and Manuel. If there are people...

87
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:41,537
It sure can tire a girl, dancing with Jess.

88
00:22:41,624 --> 00:22:42,659
Yes, miss.

89
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:54,701
Do you want to dance out
the rest of your life with him?

90
00:22:54,784 --> 00:22:57,981
Well, I admit he doesn't exactly
hang the moon for me.

91
00:22:58,064 --> 00:23:00,737
I like him. If I have to, I'll settle for him.

92
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:03,384
Do you really have to settle for anyone?

93
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:06,462
Now look, miss...

94
00:23:09,744 --> 00:23:13,020
I don't want to hold you here
like I held your mother.

95
00:23:13,104 --> 00:23:16,414
I belong here, Pa. This is my home.

96
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:34,140
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

97
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:46,502
Charlie!

98
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:51,895
- Doc!
- Coming.

99
00:23:52,944 --> 00:23:55,663
- Make way for the Doc.
- Let me get through.

100
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:58,780
- What happened?
- He fell out of that tree.

101
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:00,900
Let me take a look, Charlie.

102
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:07,937
My bag's home.

103
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:11,141
Here now, you take this thumb
and this thumb...

104
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:13,215
and press them hard together.

105
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:17,813
- Joanne, I'll come with you.
- Tarnation, Jess!

106
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:21,453
You fuss and fret too much over me.
I can look after myself.

107
00:24:22,264 --> 00:24:25,336
It's nothing serious.
Let's get back to dancing.

108
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:22,976
Nobody upstairs.

109
00:25:23,704 --> 00:25:25,774
No women, nothing.

110
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:30,097
Nothing nowhere. Rich Yanquis.

111
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:35,453
Come, Azul, there's nothing there!

112
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:45,663
GREASER

113
00:31:51,624 --> 00:31:53,421
Please.

114
00:32:03,144 --> 00:32:04,293
No!

115
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:13,140
Come on, let's go get them!

116
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,899
- Let me get on!
- No, Doc, no more room!

117
00:33:28,904 --> 00:33:31,862
I've got to get to my daughter!
My daughter...

118
00:33:52,144 --> 00:33:55,102
Find Azul and Manuel.
We will wait by the river.

119
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:27,938
Come on.

120
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:40,014
- He said for you to come.
- Leave the gringo.

121
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:45,775
Come, Azul, with me.

122
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:47,378
Leave him.

123
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:57,293
Come!

124
00:35:45,784 --> 00:35:48,298
That's Joanne's buggy. Let me off.

125
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:26,016
Come on, get them!

126
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:22,461
Come on, men, hurry up there!
Come on, boys, let's go!

127
00:37:31,704 --> 00:37:34,059
Come on, let's get him! Over here!

128
00:39:07,184 --> 00:39:10,620
Pa, don't do that.
If it hadn't been for him...

129
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,696
They'll kill him, Pa.

130
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:32,179
Fair skin, blue eyes.

131
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,332
Now, how did he come to be with them?

132
00:41:02,104 --> 00:41:03,253
We wait.

133
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:06,063
There is no use for more waiting.
It is too dangerous.

134
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:08,942
You do not understand.
Four sons are missing.

135
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,461
Antonio, Manuel, Xavier.

136
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:14,136
- Azul?
- Yes, all.

137
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:17,662
If they're alive, we find them.
We go back!

138
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,940
The gringos killed Antonio.

139
00:41:37,184 --> 00:41:39,698
- And the others?
- Manuel was murdered.

140
00:41:41,304 --> 00:41:43,818
By Azul, for attacking a gringo woman.

141
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:47,056
You are lying. You lie, Xavier.

142
00:41:49,504 --> 00:41:51,062
We go back!

143
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:55,893
To kill him or to save him?
Which, my father?

144
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:58,734
We go back, but to Mexico.

145
00:42:05,744 --> 00:42:07,143
We cross!

146
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:41,662
Pa had to work hard
putting you back together.

147
00:42:53,824 --> 00:42:55,621
We both undressed you.

148
00:42:59,424 --> 00:43:01,858
I've been a doctor's daughter all my life.

149
00:43:01,944 --> 00:43:05,175
I've seen more than one grown man
in his natural state.

150
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:07,903
The spectacle holds no surprises
for me.

151
00:43:20,304 --> 00:43:23,376
Are you up to my asking
a few pertinent questions?

152
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:25,182
What's your name?

153
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:31,655
I asked for your name, boy.

154
00:43:34,464 --> 00:43:37,695
Now look, son, I don't expect gratitude
for saving your life.

155
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,662
But I have a hunch you're strong enough
to do some talking...

156
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,018
so I'd like you to talk.

157
00:43:42,104 --> 00:43:43,776
Where are you from?

158
00:43:49,304 --> 00:43:52,694
We know you're not Mexican, boy.
Where do you belong?

159
00:43:57,944 --> 00:44:01,414
I see. It's not that you can't talk,
it's just that you won't.

160
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:03,256
Pa, it's not the time.

161
00:44:04,784 --> 00:44:06,058
All right.

162
00:44:07,624 --> 00:44:10,092
I'm not gonna force you now.

163
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:14,333
But later you're gonna tell me
everything I want to know.

164
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:20,097
Here, you come along, miss.
Come along.

165
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:24,256
Let's give him a while
to think things over a bit.

166
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:10,775
Should my tears forever flow

167
00:45:11,424 --> 00:45:15,781
Should my zeal no languor know

168
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:20,656
All for sin could not atone

169
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:25,421
Thou must save, and thou alone

170
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:30,136
In my hand no price I bring

171
00:46:44,744 --> 00:46:47,497
All I'm saying is the Governor
ought to be made aware of the matter.

172
00:46:47,584 --> 00:46:51,259
How do we know raids like last night
ain't taking place all along the border?

173
00:46:51,344 --> 00:46:54,973
There is no master plan in Mexico City,
if that's what you're thinking.

174
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:56,736
The war's over, Jess.

175
00:46:57,544 --> 00:47:01,856
A band of outlaws just crossed the river,
so let's not make any more of it.

176
00:47:02,064 --> 00:47:05,215
Well, I'll wager they never crossed back
over the river.

177
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:07,977
I wager a few of them
are still hanging around.

178
00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:11,374
If that's so,
we'll just have to take our chances.

179
00:47:11,464 --> 00:47:14,456
Hell, I don't think
we ought to take any chances.

180
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,620
Doc, Joanne.

181
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:40,262
If you're bound and determined to clear
out of here, I'm not gonna stop you.

182
00:47:40,344 --> 00:47:44,257
As a medical man, I may not advise it,
but as a member of this community...

183
00:47:44,344 --> 00:47:48,974
I'm sure not in favour of you staying.
So if you want to go, just go right ahead.

184
00:47:52,984 --> 00:47:54,895
Well, what's holding you?

185
00:48:03,184 --> 00:48:05,778
Sit down, boy. It's wiser.

186
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:18,696
Since it's obvious that
you have to put up here for a spell...

187
00:48:18,784 --> 00:48:22,572
accept that fact and answer
those questions I asked you earlier.

188
00:48:28,904 --> 00:48:30,781
Don't try me, boy.

189
00:48:31,024 --> 00:48:34,983
Just because I patched you up doesn't
mean I can't let others string you up.

190
00:48:35,064 --> 00:48:37,862
There's no point in saving a life
if it's not worth saving.

191
00:48:37,944 --> 00:48:41,539
- Where you going, miss?
- Chores, Pa. Possess yourself.

192
00:48:43,944 --> 00:48:47,254
You're hell-bent on putting me
to the test, aren't you?

193
00:48:47,864 --> 00:48:50,662
All right. You're gonna get satisfaction.

194
00:48:50,744 --> 00:48:54,054
You're gonna get it right now.
What's all that for?

195
00:48:54,144 --> 00:48:57,693
Hush, Pa, no need to make noise
for two. Excuse me.

196
00:48:58,864 --> 00:49:00,263
Have you gone plumb crazy?

197
00:49:00,344 --> 00:49:03,142
I just want to examine
this wild man's face.

198
00:49:04,744 --> 00:49:07,736
Easy, boy.
At this moment, I'm stronger than you.

199
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,383
Lather him up.

200
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:13,975
- Do as I say, Pa.
- Yes, miss.

201
00:49:28,064 --> 00:49:30,976
I think you should know I'm not
a woman of minor achievement...

202
00:49:31,064 --> 00:49:32,543
and I add to my list daily.

203
00:49:32,624 --> 00:49:36,094
I cook, sew, undertake all
the normal female activities.

204
00:49:36,384 --> 00:49:39,615
And then in addition,
I handle a plough as well as a piano...

205
00:49:39,704 --> 00:49:42,059
split a log in record quick time and...

206
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:45,056
I'm just about as good as any man,
huh, Pa?

207
00:49:45,504 --> 00:49:46,983
Did I hurt you?

208
00:49:47,824 --> 00:49:49,542
I'm fearfully sorry.

209
00:49:50,304 --> 00:49:53,023
But with all my accomplishments,
I have...

210
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,821
Now, did I do it again?

211
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:00,942
How can I apologise? Except to say that
I've never shaved a man before.

212
00:50:01,024 --> 00:50:04,653
So if my hand should falter
and my fingers slip...

213
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:20,537
- I'll do it.
- The walls of silence have crumbled.

214
00:50:21,064 --> 00:50:22,213
My God.

215
00:50:37,304 --> 00:50:38,453
Hungry?

216
00:50:57,504 --> 00:51:01,258
The wild man doesn't have
very civilised eating habits, does he?

217
00:51:01,344 --> 00:51:04,893
In time, Pa.
Infants crawl before they can walk.

218
00:51:06,704 --> 00:51:09,343
- Now...
- Doctor, you to home?

219
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:22,060
You damn fool.

220
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,742
Another sound like that
and they'll be up here.

221
00:51:31,024 --> 00:51:32,821
Give me that gun.

222
00:51:35,464 --> 00:51:38,501
I'm no hero, boy. The gun's empty.

223
00:51:58,144 --> 00:51:59,782
What is it now, Jabe?

224
00:51:59,864 --> 00:52:01,900
Alma's convinced
she's got complications again.

225
00:52:01,984 --> 00:52:05,056
I'm sure there's no cause for alarm.
Go right in.

226
00:52:06,304 --> 00:52:07,896
You must be hungry.

227
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:20,496
You know, it's mighty awkward for me
to still not know what to call you.

228
00:52:22,464 --> 00:52:25,422
I can't go on calling you "sir" and "boy."

229
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:28,423
My name are...

230
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:31,063
My name is...

231
00:52:32,784 --> 00:52:33,853
Azul.

232
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:41,053
That's Spanish for "blue," isn't it?

233
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,581
It's not my real name.

234
00:52:45,744 --> 00:52:48,895
It's a kind of...

235
00:52:49,944 --> 00:52:51,138
Nickname?

236
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,903
Yeah, nickname.

237
00:53:18,344 --> 00:53:20,141
Put your shirt back on.

238
00:53:22,184 --> 00:53:23,219
I'm all right?

239
00:53:23,304 --> 00:53:26,580
All right? As much as most
and more so than some.

240
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:30,102
Want a swig of
some honest to goodness brandy?

241
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:35,892
I can go?

242
00:53:37,704 --> 00:53:39,820
I asked if you wanted a drink.

243
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:49,699
It mightn't do you any harm
to stay on a few extra days.

244
00:53:50,624 --> 00:53:54,458
No, I figure I'll leave before sunup.

245
00:53:55,304 --> 00:53:56,976
Whatever seems fair.

246
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:04,100
Since you haven't told us
where you're from...

247
00:54:04,184 --> 00:54:07,176
I don't imagine you'll let on
where you're going.

248
00:54:11,824 --> 00:54:13,974
Have you made any plans, Blue?

249
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:23,097
I see.

250
00:54:25,664 --> 00:54:27,700
Right back where we started.

251
00:54:29,064 --> 00:54:30,383
Before you go...

252
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:33,376
I think there's something
you might wanna have.

253
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,538
We found this on you that first night.

254
00:54:40,104 --> 00:54:44,575
It might be stolen goods,
but I have a sneaky hunch it's not.

255
00:54:55,784 --> 00:54:57,217
Your mother's?

256
00:55:01,184 --> 00:55:02,219
Dead?

257
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:26,020
Where's he looking off to?

258
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:28,939
South.

259
00:55:30,784 --> 00:55:32,297
Mexico, I guess.

260
00:55:33,704 --> 00:55:36,980
Well, I reckon he feels
they are more his people now.

261
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:39,695
He can't go back to them, Pa.

262
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:42,821
He killed one of them.
He's got nowhere to go.

263
00:55:44,504 --> 00:55:48,099
No, miss.
What he does has to be his decision.

264
00:55:52,584 --> 00:55:54,222
Leave him be, girl.

265
00:57:37,104 --> 00:57:38,332
- Pa!
- Blue!

266
00:57:38,424 --> 00:57:40,301
Pa, come down here quick!

267
00:57:40,384 --> 00:57:42,022
- What is it?
- Something's happened!

268
00:57:42,104 --> 00:57:43,537
What happened?

269
00:57:47,224 --> 00:57:50,660
What? Where is he?

270
00:57:55,664 --> 00:57:57,382
What in damnation...

271
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:08,896
He's talking, Pa.

272
00:58:09,664 --> 00:58:13,862
- He's saying he wants to stay and work.
- That's talking?

273
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:20,821
He's gonna have to be
a little less subtle to suit me.

274
00:58:20,904 --> 00:58:22,098
Pa, use your senses.

275
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:24,823
We need a hand around the place.
We always needed someone.

276
00:58:24,904 --> 00:58:28,180
- Have you forgotten what he is?
- Was, Pa.

277
00:58:29,264 --> 00:58:31,983
You're always going on
about giving a man a fair chance.

278
00:58:32,064 --> 00:58:34,134
That's all Blue's asking for.

279
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:39,975
If you aren't the damndest...

280
00:58:40,064 --> 00:58:41,975
most ornery,
most blackmailing daughter...

281
00:58:42,064 --> 00:58:43,213
Yes, Pa.

282
00:58:44,504 --> 00:58:46,335
That's why you love me.

283
00:58:46,504 --> 00:58:50,099
Now I'm gonna tell Blue
how delighted you are to take him on.

284
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:40,418
They're coming.

285
01:00:42,744 --> 01:00:45,417
I sure do wish I'd never invited anybody.

286
01:00:46,344 --> 01:00:48,460
Have a do, expect some doings.

287
01:00:51,184 --> 01:00:53,015
Possess yourself, miss.

288
01:00:53,384 --> 01:00:55,898
We can't hide him from people forever.

289
01:01:25,864 --> 01:01:29,539
The good Lord and my daughter's
needle sure work miracles.

290
01:01:30,424 --> 01:01:32,415
Yes, sir, you look splendid.

291
01:01:32,864 --> 01:01:34,422
My suit fits.

292
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:37,857
It fits splendid.

293
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,616
You are gonna do just fine.

294
01:01:39,704 --> 01:01:43,617
Just stand tall and smile, and you'll
win them over with your charm.

295
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:46,424
- Charm.
- Charm, yeah.

296
01:01:49,384 --> 01:01:50,533
Hi, Jim.

297
01:01:52,424 --> 01:01:54,335
- Hi, Jess.
- Evening.

298
01:01:54,784 --> 01:01:57,457
I'm sure glad you could all come
to our social.

299
01:01:57,544 --> 01:01:59,853
Sure is nice seeing y'all again.

300
01:02:00,424 --> 01:02:02,892
Looks more like a military drill
than a social.

301
01:02:02,984 --> 01:02:06,943
Might as well come prepared, Doctor,
after what happened last time.

302
01:02:07,304 --> 01:02:08,896
How you doing, Joanne?

303
01:02:08,984 --> 01:02:11,623
Come on now, let's not dilly-dally.

304
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:15,102
Let's get in here
and get this party started.

305
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:19,742
Yeah, charm.

306
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:30,657
I see you've finally gotten somebody
to help you around the place.

307
01:02:30,984 --> 01:02:32,781
He's come here to help us out.

308
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:35,617
You and Joanne
can't farm this place alone.

309
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:39,135
Especially after what's been going on
around here lately.

310
01:02:39,224 --> 01:02:42,102
It's sure been nice talking to you,
Mr. Blue.

311
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:25,696
"The attention of every lady
was soon caught by a young man...

312
01:03:26,024 --> 01:03:28,094
"whom they had never seen before...

313
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:30,573
"of most gentlemanlike appearance...

314
01:03:30,704 --> 01:03:34,014
"walking with an officer
on the other side of the way.

315
01:03:34,384 --> 01:03:36,500
"The officer was Mr. Denny...

316
01:03:36,824 --> 01:03:39,099
"and he bowed as they passed.

317
01:03:39,624 --> 01:03:42,297
"All were struck with the stranger's air.

318
01:03:42,984 --> 01:03:45,134
"All wondered who he could be.

319
01:03:46,784 --> 01:03:48,422
"Mr. Denny addressed them..."

320
01:03:48,504 --> 01:03:50,972
We don't have many strangers
come this way.

321
01:03:51,064 --> 01:03:52,577
Last one was Mr. Saunders.

322
01:03:52,664 --> 01:03:55,622
Stayed with the Corralls
about five years ago, ain't that right?

323
01:03:55,704 --> 01:03:57,695
Yes, all of five years ago.

324
01:03:57,864 --> 01:04:00,697
You good at games like this,
Mr. Hamilton?

325
01:04:03,944 --> 01:04:05,343
I used to be.

326
01:04:05,504 --> 01:04:07,096
That's my boy Jess.

327
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:10,301
- He's real good at games.
- Yeah, I can see that.

328
01:04:11,784 --> 01:04:13,695
Come on and join us in a hand.

329
01:04:13,784 --> 01:04:16,696
Think we'd all like to see
just how good you be.

330
01:04:17,344 --> 01:04:19,778
"He had all the best parts of beauty...

331
01:04:19,864 --> 01:04:24,096
- "a fine countenance, a good figure..."
- What are you, reformed, Mr. Hamilton?

332
01:04:26,224 --> 01:04:27,623
You could say.

333
01:04:27,704 --> 01:04:32,255
"...determined if possible to find out,
led the way across the street..."

334
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,374
Just stretching my legs, Pa.

335
01:04:55,624 --> 01:04:58,343
That's a mighty special rig
you got there.

336
01:04:58,704 --> 01:05:00,615
That's Mexican, ain't it?

337
01:05:07,464 --> 01:05:10,615
"...turning back,
had reached the same spot."

338
01:05:11,784 --> 01:05:13,217
Pick them up.

339
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:17,493
I've seen a couple just like it
on some outlaws.

340
01:05:18,504 --> 01:05:19,698
Mexicans.

341
01:05:22,104 --> 01:05:25,255
Doc tell you about the trouble we had
not long back?

342
01:05:26,504 --> 01:05:27,983
He's heard about it.

343
01:05:28,064 --> 01:05:31,613
He hear about the stealing?
You tell him about the killings?

344
01:05:32,064 --> 01:05:35,101
- What are you getting at, Jess?
- Nothing, Pa.

345
01:05:37,624 --> 01:05:41,060
I'm surprised to see one of us
outfitted like one of them, that's what.

346
01:05:41,144 --> 01:05:42,816
Blue's from El Paso.

347
01:05:43,464 --> 01:05:47,093
It's common enough to pick up
Mexican goods in a border town.

348
01:05:47,384 --> 01:05:48,578
How many?

349
01:05:49,864 --> 01:05:52,981
Yeah, that's for true,
and the point is why bother?

350
01:05:53,864 --> 01:05:57,015
Unless a body happens to be partial
to bean eaters.

351
01:05:57,864 --> 01:05:59,582
You partial to them?

352
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,741
Mexicans are no worse or better
than anybody else.

353
01:06:11,024 --> 01:06:14,334
Listen to that, folks.
He is partial to them after all.

354
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,772
I wonder if he don't shoot
the way them greasers do...

355
01:06:17,864 --> 01:06:20,014
seeing as how he takes so to their gear.

356
01:06:20,104 --> 01:06:23,335
I have a busy day ahead of me.

357
01:06:23,744 --> 01:06:27,054
So if you'll excuse me, good night.

358
01:06:27,144 --> 01:06:28,816
It's a crying shame.

359
01:06:30,384 --> 01:06:33,217
I was gonna ask him to show off
his shooting techniques to us.

360
01:06:33,304 --> 01:06:35,772
And he says he's got a busy day ahead.

361
01:06:36,184 --> 01:06:39,938
There mightn't be some other reason
you're leaving our company?

362
01:06:40,984 --> 01:06:42,337
There might.

363
01:06:44,184 --> 01:06:46,334
I'm tired, Mr. Parker...

364
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:48,942
particularly of you.

365
01:07:18,144 --> 01:07:20,214
Well, are we playing or not?

366
01:07:20,864 --> 01:07:21,933
Your deal.

367
01:08:00,344 --> 01:08:02,016
What's gonna happen?

368
01:08:03,184 --> 01:08:06,335
I guess there'll be some whispering
and wondering...

369
01:08:06,744 --> 01:08:08,655
and a little speculating.

370
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:13,332
But it'll all die down soon enough.
They'll come to accept Blue.

371
01:08:16,424 --> 01:08:17,982
What in damnation was that for?

372
01:08:18,064 --> 01:08:21,454
If we're in it, we're in it,
and we might as well see it through.

373
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:42,334
- He knows.
- He only suspects.

374
01:08:45,984 --> 01:08:47,940
Nobody pays Jess any mind.

375
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:55,456
They can't forget.

376
01:08:56,944 --> 01:08:58,502
Why should they?

377
01:08:59,624 --> 01:09:01,057
I don't belong.

378
01:09:04,624 --> 01:09:06,023
It can't work.

379
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:09,857
You do belong.

380
01:11:08,424 --> 01:11:11,382
I guess I was brought out here...

381
01:11:12,424 --> 01:11:14,654
about the time your kin
settled this spread.

382
01:11:14,744 --> 01:11:16,860
What was it took them to Mexico?

383
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:19,624
What takes hold of most people
who keep on the move...

384
01:11:19,704 --> 01:11:21,103
if that's the kind they be?

385
01:11:21,184 --> 01:11:24,221
A place that sounds like it's the answer,
I guess.

386
01:11:30,824 --> 01:11:35,181
My folks settled in Mexico when I was...
How old?

387
01:11:36,664 --> 01:11:39,940
Five? Maybe six.

388
01:11:40,744 --> 01:11:44,703
There was no trouble
with the Mexicans at first.

389
01:11:45,824 --> 01:11:49,453
Of course, in those days
it was all one country, you know?

390
01:11:50,344 --> 01:11:54,223
It was just their kind of people
and our kind of people...

391
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,816
living side by side.

392
01:11:57,944 --> 01:11:59,616
Ranching, farming.

393
01:12:02,024 --> 01:12:05,858
Till the war came.
The war with Texas, that is.

394
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:10,216
Then one night...

395
01:12:11,584 --> 01:12:15,372
a group of nice people from the village
paid a call on us.

396
01:12:16,344 --> 01:12:20,940
Said we'd have to clear out by morning.

397
01:12:31,144 --> 01:12:34,261
My pa stood up to these nice people...

398
01:12:35,464 --> 01:12:37,182
and he said to them:

399
01:12:38,344 --> 01:12:41,336
"You'll have to burn me out
to make me go."

400
01:12:42,504 --> 01:12:46,053
So the next day, they did just that.

401
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:49,576
They burned him out.

402
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,223
Burned him...

403
01:12:53,544 --> 01:12:56,263
and Ma when they wouldn't
quit the house.

404
01:13:04,024 --> 01:13:05,696
When it was over...

405
01:13:08,144 --> 01:13:11,454
there was this smell...

406
01:13:14,104 --> 01:13:16,254
and smoke.

407
01:13:17,704 --> 01:13:20,582
And I just walked out of there.

408
01:13:21,224 --> 01:13:22,657
Just walked...

409
01:13:24,224 --> 01:13:26,658
walked right out to the prairie...

410
01:13:26,984 --> 01:13:29,214
where another kind of Mexican...

411
01:13:29,384 --> 01:13:33,093
a bandit named Ortega found me.

412
01:13:35,504 --> 01:13:37,893
Then he took care of me...

413
01:13:39,104 --> 01:13:43,461
brought me up
to be just like one of his own.

414
01:13:51,264 --> 01:13:52,458
Let's go.

415
01:13:53,704 --> 01:13:56,457
Jess here says
his sister's come down with the fever.

416
01:13:56,544 --> 01:13:59,342
I'm gonna stay on a piece
and talk to Joanne.

417
01:14:07,984 --> 01:14:10,817
Would you care to honour me
with your company?

418
01:14:15,624 --> 01:14:16,977
Don't be too late.

419
01:14:17,064 --> 01:14:20,136
We should be back in time for supper.
Come on, boy.

420
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:37,218
Now, there's a mighty fine piece
of farmland...

421
01:14:37,304 --> 01:14:40,102
just waiting for someone
to lay claim to it.

422
01:14:49,504 --> 01:14:53,213
He's one of them. I know it. You know it.

423
01:14:53,304 --> 01:14:56,182
For you and your pa to hide him here
and try passing him off...

424
01:14:56,264 --> 01:15:00,177
You've no proof of anything,
Jess Parker. Not a damn bit of proof.

425
01:15:07,264 --> 01:15:10,734
I'll wager you and Doc
heard some sobbing tale out of him.

426
01:15:10,824 --> 01:15:12,940
That's what I wager you heard.

427
01:15:14,064 --> 01:15:16,419
I wager you two think
you can change him over...

428
01:15:16,504 --> 01:15:19,541
just by snapping your fingers.

429
01:15:19,624 --> 01:15:21,899
People do change, Jess. They can.

430
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:25,381
That's the wondrous thing about people.
They change.

431
01:15:33,424 --> 01:15:34,903
Jess, what are you aiming to do?

432
01:15:34,984 --> 01:15:38,021
I haven't said a word
you can honestly pin to him.

433
01:15:38,184 --> 01:15:41,654
Please, Jess, leave him be.
I swear to you he's good.

434
01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:44,252
- I swear to you that he's...
- Changed?

435
01:15:45,744 --> 01:15:48,736
I wonder about that.
I really wonder about that.

436
01:15:48,864 --> 01:15:51,537
And I maybe reckon to find out if it's so.

437
01:15:53,624 --> 01:15:57,094
Jess, please, leave him be!

438
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:38,818
You comfortable squatting like that?

439
01:16:39,184 --> 01:16:43,063
- You know how you're sitting, don't you?
- You tell me.

440
01:16:43,464 --> 01:16:46,900
That's how a greaser sits.
You're sitting like a greaser.

441
01:16:49,384 --> 01:16:52,615
- What is it you want?
- I don't like you.

442
01:16:58,344 --> 01:17:02,019
- What's that gonna prove?
- What sort of person you really are.

443
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:06,536
- Which is what sort of person?
- One who ain't changed.

444
01:17:17,024 --> 01:17:19,743
Don't prod me, boy.

445
01:17:46,624 --> 01:17:50,219
Make sure she takes her quinine
and she'll be up in a day or two.

446
01:17:50,304 --> 01:17:51,896
- Jess!
- No, Pa.

447
01:18:22,024 --> 01:18:25,858
Are you gonna get yourself killed
for some crazy, damn fool notion?

448
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:30,015
Don't forget the quinine.

449
01:19:59,464 --> 01:20:01,932
It has been a long time, Azul.

450
01:20:14,504 --> 01:20:17,541
These people saved my life.

451
01:20:23,024 --> 01:20:25,254
Permit me to thank you...

452
01:20:26,784 --> 01:20:28,900
for saving the life of my son.

453
01:20:31,504 --> 01:20:34,974
It will be good to have you back with us,
Azul, as before.

454
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:43,013
Things have changed. I have.

455
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:50,982
Azul is no more.

456
01:21:08,424 --> 01:21:10,938
Then I have lost three sons here...

457
01:21:12,944 --> 01:21:14,138
not two.

458
01:21:16,864 --> 01:21:18,536
Azul was murdered...

459
01:21:19,944 --> 01:21:21,536
as Antonio was...

460
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:24,623
and Manuel.

461
01:21:26,184 --> 01:21:29,301
You did not save the life of Azul.

462
01:21:32,264 --> 01:21:34,300
You took his life from him.

463
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,333
Why?

464
01:21:38,664 --> 01:21:40,302
Leave him alone.

465
01:21:40,384 --> 01:21:42,454
It's all right, Blue.
I can look after myself.

466
01:21:42,544 --> 01:21:43,613
You?

467
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:49,219
You can look only after dirt because
that is what you are, nothing else.

468
01:21:49,584 --> 01:21:52,303
And that is what she is: Dirt.

469
01:21:52,584 --> 01:21:54,017
Yanqui dirt!

470
01:22:00,104 --> 01:22:02,015
No, we do not kill him.

471
01:22:02,904 --> 01:22:04,303
Not this way.

472
01:22:11,944 --> 01:22:14,981
So finally it is you who defies me.

473
01:22:18,784 --> 01:22:22,060
All right, defy me then, and with the fist.

474
01:22:22,864 --> 01:22:24,536
Yours against mine.

475
01:22:27,624 --> 01:22:29,342
I don't wanna fight.

476
01:22:32,584 --> 01:22:35,052
Have they turned you into a coward...

477
01:22:36,104 --> 01:22:37,822
as well as a traitor?

478
01:22:47,944 --> 01:22:49,502
Fight me, I said.

479
01:22:52,264 --> 01:22:53,379
Fight!

480
01:24:34,824 --> 01:24:37,543
This business between us
is not finished.

481
01:24:40,184 --> 01:24:43,176
I will be back with all my men.

482
01:24:44,824 --> 01:24:46,974
I will avenge the murders...

483
01:24:47,584 --> 01:24:50,303
of Antonio, and Manuel...

484
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:52,903
and Azul.

485
01:24:54,024 --> 01:24:55,776
And in their memory...

486
01:24:55,864 --> 01:24:59,095
I will put the torch
to each building and farm here.

487
01:24:59,944 --> 01:25:03,539
I will burn out
the murderers of my sons!

488
01:25:38,024 --> 01:25:40,254
Look, clear out.

489
01:25:41,144 --> 01:25:43,533
Clear out while there's still time.

490
01:25:44,504 --> 01:25:47,143
Waiting around to be slaughtered,
it's stupid.

491
01:25:47,224 --> 01:25:49,294
I don't see we have any choice
but to wait.

492
01:25:49,384 --> 01:25:51,739
There's only one choice
that makes any sense...

493
01:25:51,824 --> 01:25:54,213
and that's to live and go on living,
and not to die.

494
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:58,536
I can't say I disagree with you.
But where do you want to do your living?

495
01:25:59,184 --> 01:26:01,539
Don't you feel you belong here now?

496
01:26:06,024 --> 01:26:08,094
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

497
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:13,092
But I'm tired of hearing, thinking...

498
01:26:14,824 --> 01:26:17,861
worrying about where I truly belong.

499
01:26:18,344 --> 01:26:21,734
Whether I'm one of you, or one of them,
or one of anybody.

500
01:26:24,104 --> 01:26:26,015
Maybe I just belong to me.

501
01:26:33,704 --> 01:26:35,660
No, Pa. Let him go.

502
01:28:00,264 --> 01:28:02,459
What do we know about fighting?

503
01:28:02,984 --> 01:28:05,134
I'm a farmer and so is my son.

504
01:28:05,344 --> 01:28:08,381
You're asking me what should be done?
I just don't know.

505
01:28:08,464 --> 01:28:09,692
But to my way of thinking...

506
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:12,582
we'd all stand a better chance of it
by sticking together...

507
01:28:12,664 --> 01:28:14,859
instead of each one of us
trying to make it alone.

508
01:28:14,944 --> 01:28:16,423
That the only choices we got, Abe?

509
01:28:16,504 --> 01:28:19,018
Why wait to see them set fire
to our crops and houses?

510
01:28:19,104 --> 01:28:22,494
I'll be damned if I leave my claim
to some greaser to burn down!

511
01:28:22,584 --> 01:28:25,144
I came out here alone,
and I fought Indians alone!

512
01:28:25,224 --> 01:28:28,261
- I'm with Jim!
- You ain't fighting a few Indians!

513
01:28:29,264 --> 01:28:31,653
Those Mexicans are like
an organised army.

514
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:34,258
Some of us once fought
a real, organised Mexican army.

515
01:28:34,344 --> 01:28:36,733
- You're no match for it.
- Abe's right! Let's get out!

516
01:28:36,824 --> 01:28:39,497
- Maybe we should get out.
- Lf Abe goes, he goes without me!

517
01:28:39,584 --> 01:28:42,496
I'll tell you one thing.
My husband never would've given up.

518
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:44,779
Maybe he should have.
Then he'd still be alive!

519
01:28:44,864 --> 01:28:46,013
Hold on!

520
01:28:49,344 --> 01:28:51,938
Quarrelling is not gonna
get us nowhere.

521
01:28:52,784 --> 01:28:55,503
We need to find a way
to stand up to them!

522
01:29:20,304 --> 01:29:23,296
I still say we should be back home
defending our farms...

523
01:29:23,384 --> 01:29:25,215
instead of heading down to the river.

524
01:29:25,304 --> 01:29:28,979
You argued that back at the meeting,
and then we all agreed to go his way.

525
01:29:29,064 --> 01:29:32,295
Agreed, hell.
You all agreed, but I'm still asking.

526
01:29:32,384 --> 01:29:34,944
Why is he heading us down to the river?

527
01:29:42,104 --> 01:29:45,892
Did you hear him talking
as if he was the Lord Almighty himself?

528
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,539
"I'll lead you if you do what I tell you to...

529
01:29:49,624 --> 01:29:52,775
"when I tell you to, and how I tell you to."

530
01:29:53,864 --> 01:29:57,459
Why are we trusting him?
He could be leading us into a trap.

531
01:29:58,104 --> 01:30:01,460
And he could have killed my boy Jess
when he had cause.

532
01:30:02,464 --> 01:30:05,820
No, Alma. I say we trust him.

533
01:30:23,944 --> 01:30:25,536
Who called a halt?

534
01:30:25,624 --> 01:30:27,501
I thought we could use
a minute's breather.

535
01:30:27,584 --> 01:30:29,415
It wasn't called.

536
01:30:29,784 --> 01:30:32,617
- The heat.
- A breather's not gonna hurt anyone.

537
01:30:32,704 --> 01:30:36,333
You'll do your breathing
when I tell you to. Now move on.

538
01:30:36,784 --> 01:30:38,342
You, too! Move on!

539
01:31:20,304 --> 01:31:23,421
Take them wagons back to the canyon
and hide them.

540
01:31:24,984 --> 01:31:28,738
Most of you, stay here.
The others, cross over.

541
01:31:29,384 --> 01:31:32,694
Jess, take the men across.

542
01:31:33,064 --> 01:31:36,374
Start digging holes.
Dig them deep and brush them over.

543
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:41,297
All right, get those tools and follow me!

544
01:31:42,984 --> 01:31:45,976
We start doing the same on this side.
Women, too.

545
01:32:33,344 --> 01:32:35,175
BLACK POWDER

546
01:32:54,664 --> 01:32:55,858
Cover it.

547
01:32:57,384 --> 01:33:00,262
When you light them,
how quick will they fire?

548
01:33:16,584 --> 01:33:18,097
Come on, fellas.

549
01:33:30,864 --> 01:33:33,094
You're in your own line of fire.

550
01:33:33,384 --> 01:33:35,898
Fill them in and start over. Up there.

551
01:33:36,104 --> 01:33:38,777
Hey, Jess, he says this hole ain't right.

552
01:34:44,184 --> 01:34:46,982
Jess, move your men
back over the river.

553
01:35:02,784 --> 01:35:05,582
I figure if we come
through this tomorrow...

554
01:35:06,144 --> 01:35:07,702
you and him will...

555
01:35:10,144 --> 01:35:12,658
I no longer reckon what will be, Jess.

556
01:35:14,144 --> 01:35:15,862
So much has happened.

557
01:35:16,384 --> 01:35:18,500
You love him a lot, don't you?

558
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:24,903
I guess...

559
01:35:28,744 --> 01:35:30,302
Good luck, Jess.

560
01:35:38,064 --> 01:35:42,137
I want every gun cleaned and oiled
right away.

561
01:35:42,984 --> 01:35:44,383
So get to it.

562
01:36:14,824 --> 01:36:17,384
Now we've gotta be fair with him, miss.

563
01:36:18,344 --> 01:36:19,982
He's gotta be hard.

564
01:36:41,584 --> 01:36:44,018
You're thinking of them, aren't you?

565
01:36:53,384 --> 01:36:57,457
Blue, I know how hard it must be
to have to kill those you once loved.

566
01:36:59,504 --> 01:37:01,222
I still love them...

567
01:37:01,824 --> 01:37:03,860
in spite of what's happened.

568
01:37:04,584 --> 01:37:06,734
And what will happen tomorrow.

569
01:37:08,424 --> 01:37:10,813
But hard as it is for me...

570
01:37:12,384 --> 01:37:14,500
it's easy for me to kill also.

571
01:37:17,224 --> 01:37:20,375
You saw these hands
the night I was choking Ortega.

572
01:37:20,904 --> 01:37:22,974
You saw how it pleasured me.

573
01:37:24,144 --> 01:37:26,738
It pleasured me. I took pleasure in it.

574
01:37:27,064 --> 01:37:29,578
Like I always did, like I always will.

575
01:37:32,784 --> 01:37:34,900
I could never change, Joanne.

576
01:37:36,384 --> 01:37:38,056
It's not possible...

577
01:37:40,904 --> 01:37:42,337
if it ever was.

578
01:37:47,464 --> 01:37:49,659
Blue, I've lost you, haven't I?

579
01:39:46,384 --> 01:39:48,261
Everybody, out of sight.

580
01:40:49,784 --> 01:40:50,933
Xavier.

581
01:42:02,704 --> 01:42:03,853
Signal.

582
01:42:04,464 --> 01:42:07,217
It is too late for you
to change face, gringo.

583
01:42:07,304 --> 01:42:09,579
My father will not take you back.

584
01:42:11,664 --> 01:42:12,779
Signal.

585
01:42:36,584 --> 01:42:40,179
Careful. Head your horses
into the current.

586
01:43:04,304 --> 01:43:05,498
Go back!

587
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:12,304
Let's go back!

588
01:44:30,544 --> 01:44:31,818
Come back!

589
01:44:44,904 --> 01:44:46,178
Come back!

590
01:45:02,984 --> 01:45:04,303
Cowards!

591
01:45:28,464 --> 01:45:29,943
Hold your fire.

592
01:46:05,104 --> 01:46:08,141
You have fought well,
as a true leader should.

593
01:46:11,704 --> 01:46:13,296
Ortega honours you.

594
01:46:45,024 --> 01:46:48,221
Let me die on my side of the river...

595
01:46:49,744 --> 01:46:50,813
Azul.
